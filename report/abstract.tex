This report gives an overview of our solution for track B of the first Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge. For this challenge, the feedback vertex set problem has been solved. In total, three different algorithms have been implemented, namely: (i) the standard randomized algorithm; (ii) the iterative compression algorithm, and (iii) a solution based on tree decomposition. The solution based upon the tree decomposition was too slow and did not yield any meaningful results. The randomized algorithm worked well for instances with a relatively low $k$.  For larger $k$, iterative compression provided the best solution. Still the algorithm is only able to solve a small subset of the available problem instances.
