This report gives an overview of our solution for the track B of The 1st Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge. In this challenge the feedback vertex set problem is solved. In total three different algorithms were implemented: the standard randomized algorithm, the iterative compression algorithm and a solution based on tree decomposition. The solution based up on the tree decomposition was too slow, and did not yield any meaningful results. The randomized algorithm worked fine for instances with a relatively low k.  For larger k the iterative compression gave the best solution. Still the algorithm was only able to solve a small subset of the available problems.
