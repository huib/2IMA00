To make the algorithms faster the splitsolve algorithm is implemented.The splitsolve algorithm makes use of the divide and conquer algorithm. It first takes a graph, and removes all edges not part of a cycle, since they do not affect the outcome for the end result. This is done using a dfs from each vertex to itself. Then it detects connected components of the graph. Since the minimal feedback vertex set is equal to the union of the minimal vertex set of the connected components of a graph, the algorithm then calls one of the other algorithms for each of the new graphs. Especially for the randomized algorithm this makes a huge difference in running time, since the new running time is now bounded by the solution size of the largest possible connected component, and not for the solution size for the whole graph anymore.
